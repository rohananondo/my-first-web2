            <h3>Typographical considerations</h3>
            <p>The Elements of Typographic Style states that "at least one en [space]" should be used to indent
                paragraphs
                after the first,[2] noting that that is the "practical minimum".[3] An em space is the most commonly
                used
                paragraph indent.[3] Miles Tinker, in his book Legibility of Print, concluded that indenting the first
                line
                of paragraphs increases readability by 7%, on average.[4]

                When referencing a paragraph, typographic symbol U+00A7 § SECTION SIGN may be used: "See § Background".

            <p>In word processing and desktop publishing, a hard return or paragraph break indicates a new paragraph, to
                be distinguished from the soft return at the end of a line internal to a paragraph. This distinction
                allows word wrap to automatically re-flow text as it is edited, without losing paragraph breaks. The
                software may apply vertical white space or indenting at paragraph breaks, depending on the selected
                style.

                <p>Paragraphs are commonly numbered using the decimal system, where (in books) the integral part of the
                    decimal represents the number of the chapter and the fractional parts are arranged in each chapter
                    in
                    order of magnitude. Thus in Whittaker and Watson's 1921 A Course of Modern Analysis, chapter 9 is
                    devoted to Fourier Series; within that chapter §9.6 introduces Riemann's theory, the following
                    section
                    §9.61 treats an associated function, following §9.62 some properties of that function</p>
